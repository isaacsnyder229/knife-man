# Knife Man

It's 90's, and your dad bought you VHS camcorder.

Bunch of your friends got so excited, so they came up with a wonderful slasher movie script, and you are gonna record it.

⚠️ **Some users report that WebGL build crashes upon recording with memory leak, in that case, you can download standalone Windows version**

Windows version contains minor post-jam updates:

- Fixed typo in subtitles  
- Added hint in notes, that Bobby should not be filmed in some scenes (he is doing practical effects)  
- Fixed overlapping music on resulting movie playback  
- V-Sync was enabled
